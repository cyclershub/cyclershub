If you’re not from Spain or haven’t browsed bikepacking routes in the Iberian Peninsula, you may be unfamiliar with the city of Teruel. It’s a small provincial capital in the northeast, far removed from metropolitan and Mediterranean Spain. Besides attracting a small number of tourists with its Mudejar architecture, the province subsists mainly on the meager yields of the rocky soils. A lone bastion in the badlands, it’s a natural water stop for the faint and fading trickle of bicycle tourers going north and south on the government-funded Camino del Cid route.

Over the last few years, though, the trickle has picked up into a steady stream, with dusty bikepackers becoming a common sight in the central Plaza del Torico with its stately fountain topped by a little bull. Though neglected nationally, Teruel has recently developed into an unlikely crossroads of multiple major bikepacking routes. Having arrived via the gravel roads myself, I had a date by the iconic fountain with Ernesto Pastor, the heart and brains behind the magnificent Montañas Vacías bikepacking route project, which has been responsible for a significant part of this resurgence.

The Rider
---------

Smiling Ernesto came up and hugged me like an old friend. We sat down in one of the nearby bars, and he ordered us both a cafe con hielo to counter the unusual April heat. He started by needlessly apologizing for not saying hello last year when—unbeknown to both of us—we intersected at the Venetro Trail event in the Dolomites. We’re both a bit reserved in that way. He goes on to quiz me on which path I took into Teruel, following the story of my ride through the Maestrago region to the east with a gleam and interest in his eyes as if I was telling of a faraway land, though he certainly knows all the dirt roads and unnamed passes like the back of his hand.

Ernesto is a local anomaly. In rural Spain, young, talented folks escape to the big city as soon as they can. Yet he chose to return once he got his degree in telecommunications engineering. While his peers competed for jobs in Madrid or Valencia, he took an unfillable position in the local government in Teruel, not far from his hometown, a few mountain ranges to the north. But his motivation was not only personal. “I wanted to come back to see how I could help,” he explains, talking about the chronic brain drain in the region. And 15 years later, he’s still here and happy. “Now I can’t imagine living in a bigger city. Sometimes even Teruel is too much,” he says with a chuckle.

He and his partner spend most weekends roaming the endless gravel roads that start right at the city limit. But before he got into bikepacking, Ernesto was a road racer, wrapped up in the world of performance and competition. Faster, further, lighter. He finally hit a wall when he sustained an injury. “I was suffering mentally and physically, but I didn’t know it for a long time. I think many in that space don’t,” he says. He got better when he left that world behind, and he has a broader outlook on cycling now.

Five years ago, there were nearly no [bikepacking routes](/routes/map) in Spain, despite having all the building blocks at hand: incredible and varied geography, rich cultural history, and extensive public doubletrack networks to connect it all. Even Ernesto couldn’t appreciate the natural treasures of his home. He describes it as a kind of typical Spanish lack of self-confidence that’s especially prevalent in these neglected interior regions. Inspired by the Torino-Nice Rally and other similar bikepacking routes, he set out to create what has grown into the extensive Montañas Vacías project. He sees it as giving back to the bikepacking community that has given him so much.

### ERNESTO’S SURLY OGRE BUILD KIT

Ernesto’s gear selection for this trip reveals how conscious he is of how even small actions affect others’ behavior. The dry pine forests are a delicate tinderbox, so he brings no stove. He snacks instead local chorizo, cheese, and bread, relying on the bars for warm food. More than once, we find ourselves in front of closed doors—variability is part of Montañas Vacías. It curbs entitlement and ousts the myth of autonomy. The rest of his minimal kit lives in a mix of readymade bags and ones he sewed himself. His camera he keeps close at hand in his Quercus hip pack, which was sewn by his friend Alex in Valencia, who also joined for the group ride.

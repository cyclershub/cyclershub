## A Sturdy Companion: Frame and Build Quality

The Kona Sutra's steel frame brings a touch of classic styling to the table while ensuring durability and stability. It strikes a great balance between a comfortable riding position and responsive handling, making it a solid choice for both urban commuting and off-road adventures. The inclusion of racks and fender mounts reveals its touring potential, showing that it's ready to carry you and your gear on some serious journeys.
The build quality is excellent and provides a feel of security when leaving for the mountains and beyond.

### Gear Up for Anything: Components and Functionality

With the incorporation of a Shimano Deore 10 Speed drivetrain, the 2021 Kona Sutra ensures seamless gear shifts and dependable performance. However, it's worth noting that the included mechanical disc brakes, while serviceable, fall short compared to their hydraulic counterparts—a somewhat disappointing aspect considering the price point.

On the positive side, the bike boasts exceptional tire clearance, accommodating up to 2.2" mountain bike tires. This feature not only renders it well-suited for extended bikepacking journeys on pavement but also empowers you to effortlessly navigate through rugged terrains.

It's worth mentioning that the Sutra comes equipped with bar end shifters, which might require a period of adjustment if you're transitioning from a bike with STI shifters.

In terms of wheel components, the Sutra features WTB ST i23 rims pre-installed. While these rims are reasonably robust, they are susceptible to tearing or cracking under intense stress—a characteristic that raises concerns, particularly for a bike intended primarily for gravel riding.

### Riding Performance - How does the Sutra feel?

The experience of riding the Sutra is truly exceptional, delivering a sensation that is nothing short of remarkable. Thanks to the presence of the Brooks saddle and the included drop bar, an unparalleled level of comfort is achieved, enabling extended rides of up to ten hours to feel remarkably effortless.

It's worth noting, however, that the bike does exude a racing bike feel. While this contributes to its impressive performance, it's important to be aware that maintaining a lower profile for prolonged periods might lead to the possibility of experiencing neck strain or back discomfort, especially if you're not accustomed to such a riding position.

The Sutra truly excels across a diverse range of terrains, demonstrating its prowess whether you're covering 200km a day on impeccably smooth tarmac or navigating the challenging washboard roads of the Tajik mountains. Despite lacking suspension, the bike's design effectively minimizes the sensation of potholes and rough surfaces. Ascending uphill becomes a remarkably effortless endeavor, while the bike's stability remains unwavering even at speeds of up to 60kmh downhill, providing a reassuring and confident ride.

### Who is the Sutra for?

The Sutra is purposefully crafted as a touring bike, tailored for traversing various terrains while not specifically intended for exceptionally rugged conditions. Therefore, it's essential to acknowledge that using it extensively for mountain biking might not be the optimal choice. However, when it comes to the task it was meticulously designed for, the Sutra undoubtedly shines. Its reputation as one of the most renowned touring bikes is well-deserved, owing to its remarkable attributes.

This bike effortlessly transforms your journey into a pleasurable experience, exemplifying its proficiency. Having personally covered an impressive 16,000km with it, I'm filled with anticipation for countless more adventures alongside this dependable companion.

One of the Sutra's standout features lies in its adaptability. With provisions for numerous attachments, it accommodates up to 2.5l bottles within its frame and boasts the capability to carry substantial weight on its fork through the utilization of four secure screw holes. This combination of stability and versatility is a key factor in its excellence. The Sutra is unfazed even when laden with a substantial 50kg of baggage—a characteristic that underscores its exceptional performance and makes it truly outstanding.

### Design

Subjective as it may be, the Sutra undeniably stands out as one of the most aesthetically appealing touring bikes available. Its captivating dark blue hue complemented by the rich brown Brooks saddle creates a striking visual contrast that sets it apart from its touring bike counterparts. Rather than blending into the natural surroundings, the Sutra is intentionally designed to capture attention on the road, making it a genuine eye-catcher. This deliberate choice in aesthetics adds another layer of uniqueness to the bike's overall appeal, contributing to its allure and reinforcing its distinctiveness among touring bikes.

### Price point and value for money

Priced at 1600 €, the Sutra may not fall within the budget-friendly category, yet it undoubtedly presents remarkable value within its mid-range price range. The investment is justified by the bike's exceptional qualities and features. Its captivating aesthetics and impressive performance contribute to a package that is both visually appealing and enduring in quality. This bike isn't just a fleeting purchase; it's a sound investment that promises longevity, ensuring that it remains a cherished companion for years to come. The Sutra's combination of beauty, durability, and value make it a standout option in its price bracket.

### Personal Experience

My decision to acquire the Sutra was grounded in the aspiration to embark on a world-spanning journey, and this bike has unequivocally delivered on that purpose. Its exceptional suitability for long-distance travel becomes evident as you seamlessly cover extensive distances, while even mountainous terrains transform into manageable challenges. While I did harbor hopes for hydraulic brakes and STIs, I understand the constraints posed by maintaining the 1600€ price point.

One notable setback I encountered was the rear rim's failure after approximately 12000km, a disappointment that marked a significant drawback in my experience. Nonetheless, the chain and drivetrain have remarkably persevered, demonstrating commendable durability even after an impressive 16000km of riding—although individual experiences may vary.

Undoubtedly, the Sutra's aesthetic allure is a standout feature. Amongst a plethora of touring bikes, the Sutra's captivating design renders it my personal favorite, accentuated by the curiosity it elicits from fellow cyclists who frequently inquire, "Is that the Kona Sutra? Can I have a go?"—a testament to its popularity within the cycling community.

On the road, the Sutra has proven its mettle with seamless traversals through the Georgian mountains and the challenging Tajik Pamir Highway, underlining its remarkable reliability and capability.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the Kona Sutra 2021 emerges as a remarkable embodiment of comfort, versatility, and endurance, inviting enthusiasts to embark on journeys of exploration and adventure. This bicycle's steel frame combines classic styling with durability, striking an ideal balance between comfortable cruising and responsive handling. The inclusion of racks and fender mounts expands its potential for touring, making it a reliable companion for both urban escapades and off-road quests.

The bike's components, highlighted by the Shimano Deore 10 Speed drivetrain, ensure seamless gear shifts and dependable performance. While the mechanical disc brakes fall slightly short of hydraulic standards, the exceptional tire clearance and WTB ST i23 rims contribute to its capability to effortlessly navigate various terrains.

Riding the Sutra is an exceptional experience, offering unparalleled comfort and remarkable performance. Its adaptability shines through diverse terrains, while its stability remains unwavering, ensuring both uphill ascents and downhill descents are tackled with confidence. The Sutra's purpose as a touring bike is undeniable, excelling in traversing various landscapes and embodying adaptability, even when laden with substantial baggage.

Aesthetically, the Sutra stands out with its captivating dark blue hue and rich brown Brooks saddle, capturing attention on the road and adding to its unique charm. While priced at 1600 €, the Sutra justifies its investment through its exceptional qualities, performance, and enduring value.

In the world of bicycles that promise adventure, the Kona Sutra 2021 not only lives up to its reputation but also transcends expectations. It is a companion that effortlessly transforms exploration into an enjoyable experience, promising countless adventures for years to come. With its outstanding attributes, the Kona Sutra 2021 stands as a shining example of a bike that harmoniously blends style, functionality, and endurance, making it a standout choice for those seeking both comfort and excitement on their two-wheeled journeys.

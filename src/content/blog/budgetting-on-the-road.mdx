I've been pedaling my way across continents, soaking in sights most only dream
of. Biking through winding mountain passes, vast deserts, and bustling cities
has given me a unique perspective on our beautiful planet. But one question I
often get asked (besides "Aren't your legs tired?") is, "How do you afford it?"

Today, I'm pulling back the curtain on the financial side of this incredible
journey. While the views are priceless, the costs of food, accommodation, gear,
and the occasional unexpected hiccup can add up. So how do I keep the wheels
turning and the bank balance in check? Here's a hint: when I'm not riding, I
might just be buried in code. That's right, I've been moonlighting as a software
engineer to fund this grand adventure.

Join me as I break down my world tour budget, from the pennies spent at roadside
stalls to what I earn from tapping away on my keyboard. If you've ever wondered
about the costs of a globetrotting expedition or how to fund your own dream
trip, you're in for a treat. Let's dive into the fascinating balance of work,
passion, and the open road

These are the costs after one year of cycling, starting in Hamburg, Germany and ending in Osh, Kyrgyzstan.
